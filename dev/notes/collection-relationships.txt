=== Evaluating reliability ===

Need to be able to determine the extent of overlap
gold_codes should be included in documents:
    {
        index: int
        labels: [{},{},...]
        gold_codes: [{...},{...},...]
    }


=== Constructing scales ===
This will probably be ad-hoc....?

=== Training classifiers ===

def train_classifier( classifier_profile )
def apply_classifier( classifier_id, collection )

classifier : {
    profile : {
        created_at : ISODate,
        featurizers : [],
        training_algorithm : [],
        algorithm_parameters : {},
        include_batch_as_feature : Boolean,
        include_collection_as_feature : Boolean,
    },
    weights : {},
    reports : {
        accuracy
        alpha
    }
}

* Applying a classifier to a collection creates a new batch

==================================


How should links *among* collections work?

We need these anywhere we plan to evaluate reliability on a subsample:
    1. Task page
    2. Apply classifier
